    "    * COUNT(date) to count how many url per country per day\n",
    "    * Filter the dates: BETWEEN 2018-04-01 AND 2018-04-08\n",
    "    * Use GROUP by on country_code, date\n",
    "    * Do some research to find out how we could get the url that is most visited on the url column\n",
    "4. Repeat testing until the query performs as expected and gives the output I am looking for"
